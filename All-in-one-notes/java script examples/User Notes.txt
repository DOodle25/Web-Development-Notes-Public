User Notes for Zip Files Downloaded from CodeAve.com

The file(s) contained in this and any zip file downloaded from
CodeAve.com essentially work all the same way.  All scripts
and data should be placed in the same directory in your Personal 
or Web Server directory.  Make certain that asp (if running an asp script)
 is turned on and in many cases that user write authority is setup on that directory.
(This is especially important for any writing to a an access db or
a text file on your server).  If there is an Access db inside this 
zip file it also needs to reside in the same directory as the .asp file.
If within the zip file there is another zip file make the contents of that 
second zip a sub-directory. (Typically any scripts that involve images
are dependant on an image sub-directory)  

All Access db's are in Access2000 format.
If you're not using Access2000 you will have problems.
(What can we do about it?  Nothing it's a Microsoft thing.)
