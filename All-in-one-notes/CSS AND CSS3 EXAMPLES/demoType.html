	<h1>Learn CSS 3.0 for better web design</h1>

	<div>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is
		no path and leave a trail.</div>

	<div>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.</div>

	<div>As knowledge increases, wonder deepens.</div>

	<p>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful
		lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the
		knowledge that you are never alone.</p>

	<p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen
		or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>

	<p>It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the
		light.</p>

	<p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is
		something you design for the present.</p>

	<p>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.</p>
