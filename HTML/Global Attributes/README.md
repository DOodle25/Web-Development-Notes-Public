**Global attributes:**
Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements, and they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements. These attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. In addition to the basic HTML global attributes, the following global attributes also exist:

1. **xml:lang and xml:base**: Inherited from the XHTML specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.
2. **ARIA role attribute and the multiple aria-* states and properties**: Used for ensuring accessibility.
3. **Event handler attributes**: Attributes like onabort, onclick, onkeydown, etc., used to handle various events.
