## HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): Used for transferring data if including images in a file, each point must be addressed.

### Why HTML? 

- Comprises your document.
- Hyper text/hyperlink: accessing remote data.
- Hyper text is somewhere.
- Markup language: just a transaction.
- Transfer data as it is; there is no alteration of data.
### Why tags? 

- It's actually a script, not a program (browser).
- In the script (1994), it was primarily for transferring data.
- Netscape browser solely transferred data; the initial one.
- New browsers decode data, allowing file browsers to read the contents.
- HTML introduced different tags.
- To send a document, read data present in HTML, collect it all, and display it in a browser.
- Establishing a connection with the browser and fetching data takes time, but compressed files facilitate this process.
- With a 3mbps net, a 35kb file takes time to load; why?
    - Browsers need to read content (transferring a file).
    - External and internal links require fetching data, which can sometimes delay loading due to style or functionality requirements.
    - Initially, only attributes were provided for styling, but now they are separated in CSS.
    - Similar approach for JavaScript functionality and event handling (client-side validations).
- Node can run on the server side (e.g., Total.js for ecommerce evaluation).
- D3.js is used for animation, transforming data into animations.
- jQuery simplifies event handling in pages, compared to JavaScript.
- npm start goes to index.js to find while package.json. If no index displays, all files and ports are shown.
- Running a Django app: rendering app in views.py goes to templates. If loading class first, then it does.
- php.info file tells how to load index.html of PHP first.

## Types of HTML tags:
1. **Paired and Unpaired Tags:**
   - **Paired Tags:** These tags consist of an opening tag and a closing tag as its companion tag. Examples include `<p>` for paragraphs and `<b>` for bold text.
   - **Unpaired Tags:** These tags only have an opening tag and do not have a closing tag. Examples include `<hr>` for horizontal lines and `<img>` for images.

2. **Self-Closing Tags:**
   - These tags do not have a partner tag, where the first tag is the only necessary tag that is valid for the formatting. Examples include `<img>` for images.

3. **Utility-Based Tags:**
   - **Formatting Tags:** These tags help in formatting texts, such as `<font>`, `<b>`, `<u>`, etc. They can also include tags like `<div>` and `<span>` for setting layout and divisions.
   - **Structure Tags:** These tags help in structuring the HTML document, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc. They do not affect text formatting.
   - **Control Tags:** These tags are used for managing content or scripts, such as `<script>`, form elements like radio buttons or checkboxes, `<form>`, etc.

Additionally, HTML tags can also be divided into other basic categories like Basic HTML Root Tags, Audio and Video Tags, Form and Input Tags, Frame Tags, Link Tags, List Tags, Table Tags, Style Tags, Meta Tags, etc.
