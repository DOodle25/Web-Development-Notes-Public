# React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the underlying data changes.

## Getting Started

To get started with React.js, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js: React.js requires Node.js to be installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

2. Create a new React app: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-app
    ```

    This will create a new directory called `my-app` with a basic React project structure.

3. Start the development server: Navigate to the `my-app` directory and start the development server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cd my-app
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open your app in the browser.
