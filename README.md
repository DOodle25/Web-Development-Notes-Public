## Overview ([Link to All in One Notes](./All-in-one-notes/README.md))
The MEARN stack is a popular web development stack that combines MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, React.js, and Node.js. It is widely used for building modern and scalable web applications.

- **HTML**: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage.

- **CSS**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements and define their appearance. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a webpage.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is used to create interactive features, handle user events, and manipulate the content of a webpage.
## MEARN Stack Overview
The MEARN stack is a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, React.js, and Node.js. It is a popular web development stack used for building modern and scalable web applications.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON and allows for easy integration with Node.js.

- **Express.js**: Express.js is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of robust features for building web applications and APIs, such as routing, middleware, and template engines.

- **Angular**: Angular is a powerful front-end framework for building dynamic web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for building complex user interfaces and managing application state.

- **React.js**: React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface based on changes in data.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications using JavaScript.

The MEARN stack combines these technologies to provide a full-stack solution for web development. It allows developers to build end-to-end web applications using a consistent and efficient development workflow.
