# Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling you to build scalable and high-performance web applications.

## Overview

- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for handling concurrent requests.
- It provides a rich set of built-in modules and a vibrant ecosystem of third-party libraries, making it easy to develop web applications.
- Node.js is widely used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications, microservices, and more.

## Key Concepts

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Node.js leverages asynchronous programming to handle multiple requests efficiently, using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax.
- **Modules**: Node.js uses a module system that allows you to organize your code into reusable and maintainable components.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, providing access to thousands of open-source libraries and tools.
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Node.js is built around an event-driven architecture, where events trigger callbacks, allowing for scalable and responsive applications.
- **Streams**: Node.js provides a powerful stream API for handling large amounts of data efficiently.

## Industry Tools

- **Express.js**: A popular web application framework for Node.js, providing a simple and flexible way to build web APIs and server-side applications.
- **Socket.IO**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server, making it ideal for building chat applications and collaborative tools.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database often used with Node.js, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that allows you to package your Node.js applications along with their dependencies, making deployment and scaling easier.
